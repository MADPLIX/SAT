# SOUND ANIMATION TOOL

This Blender addon analyzes `.wav` or `.mp3` audio files to extract either the tempo (BPM)
or frequency-based energy data (Kick, Bass, Snare, Hihat). It then creates animation keyframes 
based on the analysis – perfect for music-driven visual effects.

## Features
- BPM detection with manual override
- Animated impulse curve generation
- Frequency band analysis and reactive animation
- Location, Rotation, Scale and Bone animation support
- Motion presets (Shake, Pulse, Wobble)
- Modular and beginner-friendly UI
